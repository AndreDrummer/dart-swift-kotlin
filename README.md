## Dart, Kotlin, and Swift: A Cross-Language Comparison

This repository is a comprehensive comparison of common usages and patterns in three popular programming languages: **Dart**, **Kotlin**, and **Swift**. It focuses on how core concepts, syntax, and features are implemented across these languages, providing side-by-side examples to help developers transition between them or understand their nuances.

### Get Started:
Browse the code examples, or clone the repository to experiment locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreDrummer/dart-kotlin-swift-comparison.git
```

### Languages Covered:
- **Dart**: A client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform, widely used in **Flutter** development.
- **Kotlin**: A modern, concise programming language that's fully interoperable with Java and designed primarily for Android development.
- **Swift**: Apple's powerful and intuitive language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development.

### Key Areas of Comparison:
1. **Variable Declarations & Types**: 
   - Declaring and initializing variables with types and inference.
   - Mutable vs immutable variables (`var` vs `val` in Kotlin, `var` vs `let` in Swift, `var` and `final` in Dart).

2. **Control Flow**:
   - `if-else`, `switch-case`, `when` (Kotlin), and `switch` (Swift) comparisons.
   - Loops: `for`, `while`, `forEach` with functional examples.

3. **Collections & Iteration**:
   - Lists, Sets, and Maps across all three languages.
   - Immutability in collections (`List`, `Set`, `Map` in Dart, Kotlin, and Swift).
   - Filtering, mapping, and reducing collections.

4. **Functions**:
   - Function declarations, return types, and lambdas/closures.
   - Named parameters, optional parameters, and default values.
   - Higher-order functions and function references.

5. **Object-Oriented Programming**:
   - Classes, inheritance, and interfaces/protocols.
   - Encapsulation and access control (`private`, `public`, `protected`).
   - Abstract classes and interfaces.

6. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Promises/Futures in Dart, `coroutines` in Kotlin, and `async/await` in Swift.
   - Error handling with `try-catch`, `Result` types, and exception propagation.

7. **Null Safety**:
   - How each language deals with nullable types and prevents null reference errors.
   - `null` handling, `?` operator in Kotlin, and `?` in Dart.

8. **Packages/Dependencies**:
   - How to manage third-party packages and dependencies using `pub` (Dart), `Gradle` (Kotlin), and `Swift Package Manager` or `CocoaPods` (Swift).

9. **Platform-Specific Features**:
   - Key features unique to each platform (Dart/Flutter, Kotlin/Android, Swift/iOS).
   - Interoperability with native code.

### Why this Comparison?
- **For Mobile Developers**: Whether you're transitioning between **Flutter**, **Android**, or **iOS** development, this repository will help you quickly understand the similarities and differences between Dart, Kotlin, and Swift.
- **For Polyglot Programmers**: If you're interested in learning how different modern languages solve common programming tasks, this comparison provides insights into their design philosophies and syntax.
- **For Learning Purposes**: By looking at equivalent code snippets across languages, you'll gain a deeper understanding of each language's strengths and trade-offs.

### Structure:
Each language has its own directory with subdirectories for each key area of comparison. Each subdirectory contains code examples and explanations in Dart, Kotlin, and Swift.

- `/dart/`: Dart examples.
- `/kotlin/`: Kotlin examples.
- `/swift/`: Swift examples.

### How to Contribute:
Feel free to submit pull requests with additional examples or improvements! Contributions that expand the comparison to cover more language features or provide clearer explanations are always welcome.
